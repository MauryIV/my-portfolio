          Welcome to my portfolio! I'm so happy that you are here to see some of my
          capabilities. I hope you see this site with glee and consider me for a position
          in your company. I am always wanting to expand my knowledge and am excited to 
          do so.
          </p>
          <p>
          A little about me now. I am 33 years old and am relatively new to programming. 
          It isn't something I had ever even considered as a possibility until
          I started meeting up with a few of my close friends for board game nights 
          every other Friday. All three of them work in this field and I would often
          talk to them about my frustrations in the construction trade. It has
          treated me well, but I wanted something that was more mentally challenging.
          My friends mentioned to me working in the computer programming industry. They 
          noticed how I tend to analyze fine detail in the games for a better, more 
          complete experience. Because of that, they believed I would enjoy the field of 
          programming. I decided to see what all I could achieve on my own, learning a 
          bit of Python. I found great joy in a new way to create something from nothing.
          It inspired me in a manner I haven't experienced in a long time. I then 
          decided to take a bootcamp class to get into the field as soon as I could. I 
          must say I'm extremely excited to continue my education in the industry. Thank 
          you so much for taking the time to learn more about me. Regardless of who you 
          may choose for the best fit in your company, I hope this brings some sort of 
          inspiration in your own life as well.
