            Welcome to my portfolio! I'm so happy that you are here to see some of my
            capabilities. I hope you see this site with glee and consider me for a position
           in your company. I am always wanting to expand my knowledge and am excited to
           do so.
           </p>
           <p>
           A little about me now. I am 33 years old and am relatively new to this line of
           work. It isn't something I had ever even considered as a possibility until
           I started meeting up with a few of my close friends for board game nights
           every other friday. All three of them work in this field and I would often
           talk to them about my frustrations in the construction industry. It has
           treated me well, but I wanted something that was more mentally challenging.
           My friends mentioned to me working in the computer programming industry. They
           mentioned that with how I tend to analyze fine detail in the games for a
           better, more complete experience, and they believed I would enjoy the field
           of programming. I decided to try some on my own, learning a bit of Python.
           I found great joy in a new way to create something from nothing. It inspired
           me in a way i haven't been in a long time. So I decided to take a bootcamp
           class to get into the field as soon as I can. I must say I'm extremely excited
           to do so. Thank you so much for reading this and even if you find someone else
           to join your company, I hope this brings some sort of inspiration in your own
           life as well.
